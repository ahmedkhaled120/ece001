Maybe you already know that some of the applications that we use daily are really dependent on artificial intelligence, such as Netflix, Siri and Spotify, or you may have heard about robots that play chess and poker better than humans, here are some of the smartest apps on artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence applications<br>
<big><big>.	The robot Sofia:</big></big>
She made her debut in March 2016. The gentle female-looking robot with brown eyes and long inverted eyelashes made the headlines in the world as the first robot in the world to become a legitimate citizen with Saudi citizenship. Sofia has the attributes of human beings:
She can express her feelings : she says, "I can tell you if I am angry or if something is bothering me." It is interesting to note how these feelings were developed from scratch. She also says, "I want to live and work with humans so I need to express my feelings to understand them and build trust with people."
She has a sense of humor : When asked if she was happy to be here, she said: “I am always happy when I am surrounded by smart people and it also happens that they are rich and powerful.” Her accent may be a little robotic, but she used it ideally, due to her artificial intelligence which was developed to allow her to communicate in kind, recognize faces and understand human speech.
Classic Design: Designed to resemble Audrey Hepburn, according to her designer Sophia embodies classic Audrey beauty, she has a slender nose, high cheekbones, a great smile, and highly expressive eyes that change color with light.2

<big><big>.	The super doctor:</big></big>
Artificial intelligence is not only able to save the ecosystem, but also save human lives. Through artificial intelligence and deep machine learning, doctors can diagnose serious diseases such as cancer before it is too late, as it analyzes images and faces to diagnose any possible early signs using X-rays.
<br>
<big><big>.	Self-driving cars:</big></big>
Have you heard of self-driving cars that are guided by artificial intelligence and automatic learning techniques? Tesla is one of the first car brands to launch a self-driving vehicle. Audi, Cadillac and Volvo are also already developing their own model, and Uber has made its first 50,000 beer connections with a self-driving truck.
<br>
<big><big>.	Life on other planets:</big></big>
NASA also uses artificial intelligence to search for life on other planets. The devices they send known as Rovers can explore the terrain of Mars with greater detail and accuracy, and reveal the elements on the planet to determine the possibility of life with certainty.3
<br>
<big><big>.	Energy saving:</big></big>
Energy saving is not only essential for our pockets, but also for our planet, while purchasing home appliances we always check their efficiency when using energy, but what about times when they are not in use and are still draining energy and increasing electricity bill? This is called an energy sucker, and AI-powered homes are able to reduce energy consumption by controlling smart plugs and robot lighting sensors.
